<p>Welcome to my WEB 120 portal page. My name is Melissa and I am currently completing my programming certificate at Seattle Central College. I am an aspiring Software Engineer who loves to work with backend development and enjoys front end develoment.</p>

<p>I grew up in central Washington and moved to Seattle in 2014 to complete my bachelor's degree in Philosophy, with a specialization in phenomenology, hermeneutics and postmodernism, at Seattle University. After working in social services and as a nanny, I have decided to shift career paths and pursue a career in tech.</p>
