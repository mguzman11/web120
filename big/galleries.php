<h2>Galleries</h2>
<p>What is a gallery and how can it add value to my website? A gallery is a way of displaying media, typically photos, on a website that visitors can interact with.  There are several ways this can be done, and several different display or view options. Most galleries are created using HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript. However, since many people use a framework such as WordPress or Squarespace for their site, there are plugins or extensions that can be added to your framework that function as a gallery on your site.</p>

<p>Squarespace offers two options, a gallery block and a gallery page.  The display options are slideshow, carousel, grid and stack. Squarespace’s gallery blocks are not template dependent and can be used with most templates without needing to be changed, however their gallery pages are template dependent and must be changed if you are changing the template of your website.  Deciding which one is right for you, may depend on how often you like to change the template of your website. A gallery block is more flexible than a gallery page.</p> 

<p>WordPress users have similar options when selecting a gallery for their page. WordPress uses plugins that can range from free to $99 depending on which plugin you decide works best for your site. Proponents of these plugins state that galleries are a practical way for your site’s visitors to view media without needing to scroll all the way down the page. “Galleries can be inserted into your website using shortcodes, or directly through the WordPress editor.” thus, making it very easy to use. Some advantages to using these types of plugins is that they can offer right-click image protection, adding pagination, password protection, Instagram importing, tags and watermarking of your photos.</p>

<p>One great benefit of using extension or plugin galleries is that you do not have to build it from scratch; often these can be purchased and used on your site, thus saving you many, many hours of hard work and testing. Using a gallery also adds a bit of sophistication to your site and looks professional. However, one drawback is that no matter how you choose to use a gallery, be sure to optimize your photos, as too much content can slow down the speed of your site, and no one likes a site that takes forever to load! </p>
