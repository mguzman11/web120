<h2>Flexbox</h2>
<p>Gone are the days of using invisible tables and using “float” to create substandard layouts on webpages. Flexbox is here to stay, and can efficiently and beautifully create complex layouts on your webpage. Flexbox is a CSS layout that distributes space along a single row or column.This feature is now widely supported in all modern browsers.  Flexbox is similar to grid, however, unlike grid’s multiple columns and rows, flexbox is for a single row or column that spans the page.</p>

<p>This feature is particularly useful now that many website visitors view web pages via their mobile phone or tablet, not on a computer. Flexbox ensures that elements placed inside the flexbox will be displayed properly, no matter what device is being used. This makes doing responsive web design feasible and no longer in need of a subdomain to host your mobile accessible site. Your main website, with responsive capabilities, will be the only one that needs to be built. </p>

<p>The use of flexbox is relatively easy. Flexbox can only go in one direction. However, this does not limit its capabilities. Values that can be used for the flex-direction property are: row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse. It uses a display setting with one of two values: flex and inline-flex. By setting the display to flex, the container now acts like a block-level element. Or if you prefer, the inverse is also true, by setting the display to inline-flex, the container now acts like an inline-level element. When setting an element in a flexbox, the element becomes a flex container and its children a flex item.</p>

<p>If for some reason a browser does not support flexbox, the browser will ignore the settings and will resort to the element’s defaults behavior.  For many of the elements, it will be display: block.  Of course, depending on your audience, your web designer should keep this in mind when building you a responsible layout using flexbox.</p>
