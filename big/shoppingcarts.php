<h2>Shopping Carts</h2>
<p>Are you an entrepreneur wanting to extend your talents in business to the world wide web? Have a product you know will sell fast if only you could reach more people? Well, adding a shopping cart to your website may be just the answer you are looking for. </p>

<p>There are three types of online shopping carts available for you to add to your website: open-source, licensed and hosted ecommerce platform.  Each of these options have their advantages and disadvantages, but the right one for you will depend on your business’s needs. An open-source shopping cart may be built by a community of developers who offer their shopping cart for free. These types of shopping carts need to be loaded onto your server and you will need to update them as needed with newer versions of the software.  While the shopping care is free, you may need to calculate the cost of maintaining such a software, especially if you yourself are not tech savvy.</p>

<p>A licensed shopping cart may be the right choice for you if you are comfortable doing your own updates, uploading it to your server and maintaining it. The single biggest difference between open-source and a licensed shopping cart is that a licensed shopping cart is built by one company and is sold directly to you. These companies may provide additional updates and support for a fee.</p>

<p>The last type of shopping cart is one that is hosted through an e-commerce platform like Shopify. With these, you do not host the shopping cart and are not responsible for its maintenance, however, there is often a service fee or monthly subscription cost associated with these types of platforms.</p>

<p>Open-source and licensed shopping carts are 100% customizable, whereas a hosting platform shopping cart may not be as customizable as you’d wish. These are just a few of the things to consider when asking your website developer to build a shopping cart feature into your amazing new website. </p>
