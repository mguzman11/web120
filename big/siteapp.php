<h2>Site vs App</h2>
<p>Just imagine, the business you started last year is finally beginning to take off, you are growing rapidly and your customers are asking how to digitally connect with you. So you aren’t sure what to go with, a responsive website or a mobile app? But first you ask, what’s the difference?!? We are on Facebook and Instagram, isn’t that enough? Nope! Here’s what you need to know to make such a decision.</p> 

<p>First, let’s dig into the differences and then we can discuss the pros and cons of each to help you decide which is best for your needs. A responsive website is a website that is designed with mobile users in mind. An application is downloaded on a device, specifically built for that operating system, and then accessed by the user, sometimes with or without internet connection. Both are generally user friendly, built with the end user in mind and can help your business grow, but the big difference is who you want to reach and how you want to interact with them.</p> 

<p>According to Dmitry Garber, from belitsoft.com, people often explore a new brand via a mobile website first not through an app. This is because users tend to be reluctant to download an app from an unfamiliar source. If new customers are your target audience, then going with a responsive mobile website may be the right option for you. Ashday Media Group states, “Modern responsive websites are more than traditional html and css, they utilize robust frameworks that are closer to an app than a static website. Sites like this are known as web apps. It may have the same appearance of a mobile app, as well as most of its capabilities, but a web app doesn’t require a user to download it -- it just loads in-browser in place of the regular website.” Thus, using a responsive mobile site, may be less expensive and still provide the user experience you desire to give your customers.</p>

<p>However, the largest drawback from a responsive website is that you need internet connection, with a mobile app, you may forgo the need to have a connection, but there is a cost. A native applicatication will cost significantly more to build and maintain. If your target audience is not new customers, but existing clients, and desire to provide them with a premium user experience, a native app may be what you are looking for. A native app is more functional than a mobile web app, and can deliver lots of content and relies heavily on the user experience.  A platform such as Facebook, Instagram or Reddit make great use of mobile apps, and this makes sense for their intended audience.</p> 

<p>When deciding to go with a mobile web app, responsive web page or a native app, the two largest factors to consider are cost and target audience. The user experience may be better in a native app, but users don’t want to download an app for occasional use. In making your final decision, always ask yourself, what type of experience do I want to provide my client and how often will they need to use this digital format? This will help you determine what is best for your budget and customer needs. </p>
